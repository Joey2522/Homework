# UT Bootcamp Challeng #1

## Description

I was able to add semantic HTML to the existing code. I was also able to add "alt" attributed to the images to make them more accessible. I cleaned up the code in general and added a few comments for context. I changed a few of the stylings in the css sheet as well.
